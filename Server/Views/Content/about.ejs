                It is never too late to follow your passion which is why I am pursuing a new career as a software engineer. I am also a self-taught artist, I like to see things in different perspectives and 
                this skill allows me to find different solutions to all problems
                I am presented with. I am a strong believer that we never stop learning, as there is always something new to explore, specially in the dynamic
                word of technology.
